# Comparing-the-Different-Classification-Algorithms
This code provides a comparison of several classifiers on synthetic datasets. It illustrates the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers.
<br>1. Import the necessary libraries. <br>
<br>2. Define the Classifiers to be compared. <br>
<br>3. We compare the following Classification methods: Decision Tree, Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear SVM, RBF SVM and Random Forest. <br>
<br>4. Create the datasets and iterate through the datasets and models and plot the results to visually observe the difference between their classification boundaries and also display their classification accuracy. <br>
